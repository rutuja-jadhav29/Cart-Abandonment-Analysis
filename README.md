# Cart-Abandonment-Analysis


**1. Problem Statement: Understanding Cart Abandonment**

The eCommerce industry faces high cart abandonment rates, leading to significant lost revenue. However, abandoned carts also offer an opportunity to identify where customers 
are dropping off in the purchasing process. By understanding why shoppers abandon their carts, businesses can take proactive steps to reduce abandonment and improve the 
customer experience.

**2. Business Questions to Answer**

To tackle cart abandonment, it is essential to address some key questions that help pinpoint where the issues are arising:

Device-Specific Abandonment: What are the cart abandonment rates across different devices (desktop, mobile, tablet)?

Product-Specific Abandonment: Which product categories experience the highest rates of abandonment? Are there certain products that are frequently abandoned?

Time-Specific Trends: Are there specific times of the day, days of the week, or months where cart abandonment spikes? What seasonal trends exist?

**3. Customer Insights: Demographics and Cart Trends**
By analyzing customer data from various cities, we can observe interesting patterns regarding cart abandonment. 

The following insights were drawn from city-specific analysis:

Sydney had the highest number of customers (213), followed by New York (209), Berlin (206), London (187), and Mumbai (185). The most common age for customers is 40, with 
almost equal gender distribution across the customer base. However, Berlin and London have a higher proportion of female shoppers, while Mumbai, New York, and Sydney see a 
higher number of male customers.

Electronics (Headphones, Smartphones) and Home & Kitchen products (Blenders) show the highest demand across all cities.

**4. Cart Abandonment Rate by Product Category**
The analysis of the top 10 products added to carts revealed that several products, especially in the Apparel and Electronics categories, have high abandonment rates.

For example: 

Jackets had the highest abandonment rate at 56.50%.

Headphones, Smartphones, and Smartwatches from the Electronics category also showed significant abandonment rates.

Apparel products like Jackets and Dresses were abandoned at rates above 55%, indicating potential issues like high prices, lack of product details, or poor shopping 
experience.

**5. Cart Abandonment Trends Across Devices**

Cart abandonment rates were measured across different devices to assess how device-specific issues might be impacting abandonment:

Mobile devices had the highest abandonment rate at 50.62%.

Tablets (49.98%) and Desktops (49.55%) showed slightly lower rates, but still significant.

These numbers suggest that abandonment is not only a mobile problem, but a cross-platform issue. This highlights the need for optimizing the user experience on all devices.

**6. Time-Specific Cart Abandonment Trends**

There were clear seasonal trends regarding cart abandonment: May and August experienced higher abandonment rates, which may be linked to factors such as seasonal shopping patterns or sales promotions.

Apparel and Beauty & Personal Care categories saw the highest abandonment rates in specific months like May (Apparel - 59.25%) and April (Beauty - 63.24%).

Actionable Insight: Focus on improving the checkout experience and offering incentives during these months (e.g., cart reminders, special discounts) to reduce abandonment.

**7. Customer Retention: Analyzing Cohorts**

Customer retention is crucial for eCommerce businesses, as it helps to build long-term relationships with shoppers. However, retention rates typically decline over time. 

For instance: Retention rates drop significantly as customers move further from their initial purchase month. For example, a cohort from 2023-01 saw retention drop from 100% to 32.74% by Month 11.

Recommendation: Engage customers early with personalized marketing, loyalty rewards, and targeted promotions to boost retention and reduce churn.

**8. Hypothesis Testing for Cart Abandonment**

We conducted several hypothesis tests to analyze factors that could influence cart abandonment:

**Hypothesis 1**: Cart abandonment rate is higher for males compared to females.

Null Hypothesis (Ho): There is no significant difference in cart abandonment rates between males and females.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Males have a higher cart abandonment rate compared to females.

We performed a t-test to compare abandonment rates between male and female customers. The p-value was found to be greater than 0.05, meaning we failed to reject the null 
hypothesis. Therefore, there is no significant difference in cart abandonment rates between males and females at the 95% confidence interval.

**Hypothesis 2**: Cart abandonment rate is dependent on device type.

Null Hypothesis (Ho): There is no significant difference in mean cart abandonment rates across different device types.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in cart abandonment rates across device types.

ANOVA analysis revealed a p-value greater than 0.05, meaning we failed to reject the null hypothesis. This implies there is no significant difference in abandonment rates 
between devices.

**Hypothesis 3**: Cart abandonment rate is higher for high-value products compared to low-value products.

We conducted a t-test comparing the abandonment rates for high-value and low-value products. The p-value was found to be greater than 0.05, meaning there is no significant 
difference between the abandonment rates for high and low-value products.

**9. Recommendations and Actionable Insights**
Based on the insights from the data analysis, the following strategies can help reduce cart abandonment:

**Optimize Checkout Experience:**

Improve the mobile checkout process to address the high abandonment rate on mobile devices.

Simplify the checkout process across all devices, ensuring faster load times, clear payment options, and minimal friction.

Offer Incentives and Promotions: Use targeted discounts, retargeting ads, or limited-time offers to encourage customers to complete their purchases, especially during high-abandonment months like May and 
August.

**Improve Product Information:**

For categories like Apparel and Electronics, ensure detailed product descriptions, competitive pricing, and sizing guides to reduce uncertainty and increase conversion.

**Enhance Customer Retention:**

Focus on customer engagement in the first 3-6 months after a purchase. Implement loyalty programs, personalized offers, and regular follow-ups to improve long-term retention.

Localized Marketing for High Abandonment Cities: For cities like London and Berlin, localize shipping terms, payment methods, and offer city-specific promotions to address abandonment issues.

**Conclusion**

Cart abandonment is a complex issue in eCommerce, influenced by various factors such as device type, product category, and seasonality. However, by analyzing abandonment 
trends, customer behavior, and conducting hypothesis testing, businesses can gain valuable insights to reduce abandonment rates and enhance the customer experience. By implementing targeted strategies like optimizing the checkout process, offering incentives, and improving product information, eCommerce businesses can significantly recover 
lost sales and improve their bottom line.
